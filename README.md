# **Clustering Methods Analysis üß©**

Welcome to the **Clustering Methods Analysis** project! This repository is dedicated to exploring and evaluating different clustering techniques like **K-means** and **Hierarchical Clustering**. We'll work our magic on both synthetic and real-world datasets, unveiling hidden patterns and groups in the data!

## **Project Overview**

In this project, we:

1. **Apply Clustering Techniques:**  
   Use K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to uncover patterns and groupings in various datasets.

2. **Evaluate Clustering Performance:**  
   Validate the clustering results using external and internal validation metrics to determine the best clustering method for each dataset.

3. **Visualize the Data:**  
   Create 2D and 3D scatter plots to visualize the data points and see how well our clusters align with the original classes.

## **Tasks Covered üìù**

### **Task 1: Synthetic and Real-World Data Clustering**
- Perform clustering on datasets (`Data1.csv` to `Data8.csv`) using K-means and hierarchical clustering.
- Validate clustering performance using external metrics.
- Visualize the data with 2D/3D plots, comparing original and clustered classifications.

### **Task 2: World Indicators Clustering**
- Use clustering to group countries based on different world indicators.
- Validate the clusters using internal metrics.
- Determine the best clustering solution and list countries in each group.
- Create scatter plots, such as "Life Expectancy vs GDP" and "Infant Mortality vs GDP."

## **Installation and Setup üöÄ**

To get started, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, and `scipy`

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn scipy
```

## **How to Run the Code üíª**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/clustering-methods-analysis.git
   cd clustering-methods-analysis
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook clustering_analysis_project.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow along with the code and enjoy the journey of clustering!
